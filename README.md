## Scope of this project

This project is an attempt to convert [Direct3D 9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct3D#Direct3D_9) programs
to [Direct3D 11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct3D#Direct3D_11).
It reimplements the `d3d9.dll`, which contains the core D3D9 interfaces.

Most D3D9 games are CPU limited on modern PCs, since GPU power increased exponentially while CPUs fell behind.
Furthermore, most (old) games lack multithreading support, draining the CPU resource even more.

This project uplifts the games D3D9 graphics API calls to D3D11.

**Note**: **the project is currently under heavy development. Currently, it is _not_ capable of running _real games_**. You are welcome to build and test it yourself if you want to.

**Important**: this project **should be used together with [DXVK](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/)**, which would then translate D3D11 to Vulkan.
**Without DXVK, this project will probably not provide any performance improvement, more likely will degrade performance.**

## Documentation

[**Read the documentation online on GitHub Pages!**](https://gabrielmajeri.github.io/d3d9-to-11/)

All of the project's documentation is stored in the [docs](docs/index.md) directory
